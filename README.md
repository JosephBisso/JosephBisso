  <details><summary>Little Backstory </summary><p>
    
  - This project was initially a project we did for the programming course at the University. We were asked to programm a little appilcation as a test to pass the class and we taught a Covid-Tracker would be a pretty nice thing to programm. It was our first project for all of us, and we learned a lot of things and gained a lot of programming experience. After we passed the class, I decided to continue working on the project myself. Small bugs still need to be fixed and the computing time is still a bit long. The data set used at the beginning has also been changed and the program still needs to be adapted and optimized to this new format.
