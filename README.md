  - A tool for visualizing Covid Data in Europa. 

  <details><summary>Little Backstory </summary><p>
    
  - This project was initially a project we did for the programming course at the University. We were asked to programm a little appilcation as a test to pass the class and we taught a Covid-Tracker would be a pretty nice thing to programm. It was our first project for all of us, and we learned a lot of things and gained a lot of programming experience. After we passed the class, I decided to continue working on the project myself. Small bugs still need to be fixed and the computing time is still a bit long. The data set used at the beginning has also been changed and the program still needs to be adapted and optimized to this new format.

![made-with-QtCreator](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-QtCreator-6cc644.svg)

- **StellarLink** is a 2D mini game / **Fall Physic Simulator** written in **Qt/QML**, **C++** and **JavaScript**.

- In the game, you control a little ball cruising on the moon and enjoying a nice view on the planet Earth. 
  
  Get a glimpse of the game's mechanics through the GIF below:

![Xilink](https://img.shields.io/badge/Xilinx%20Zynq-FPGA-green.svg)

- **FPGA Logic Analyser** is a hardware project implemented on an FPGA board using **VHDL**.
- The project is an **8-channel** logic analyser capable of sampling digital signals at up to **1â€¯MHz**, with visualization via **VGA output**. Implemented on a Xilinx FPGA board, it captures and displays signal states for debugging and educational purposes, demonstrating practical digital design and hardware interfacing.

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Josephbisso/aviosense_mode_s.svg)](https://github.com/JosephBisso/aviosense_mode_s/releases) 
- **Aviosense MODE-S** is a **Data analaysis** app written in **python**, **Qt/QML** and **JavaScript**.

- Aviosense MODE_S aims to make statements on turbulence using available data from MODE-S receiversn thanks a automated procedure for data transfer and calculation of the given approach while increasing the temporal and spatial scale of the data set used for the calculation

### [Card game](https://github.com/JosephBisso/Cardgame)
[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Josephbisso/Cardgame.svg)](https://github.com/JosephBisso/Cardgame/releases)
![tested-with-JUnit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tested%20with-JUnit-6e5494.svg)
- Cardgame is a implementation of a physical Card game. For now there is only one pre-programmed Game but with this programm you can play a large number of card games if you know the rule and want to create a new Game with existing rules. But more (popular) Games are definitling in the way. Stay tunned!

- Your opponents will be AIs. The last Player with remaining Card loose the Game. For now neither the number of Ais nor their Level can be changed, but I played a couple hundred games and sometimes I win and sometimes I loose. Either way I had a lot of fun

- This project is written and _tested automatically_ using **Gradle** and **JUnit**
