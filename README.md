  - A tool for visualizing Covid Data in Europa. 

  <details><summary>Little Backstory </summary><p>
    
  - This project was initially a project we did for the programming course at the University. We were asked to programm a little appilcation as a test to pass the class and we taught a Covid-Tracker would be a pretty nice thing to programm. It was our first project for all of us, and we learned a lot of things and gained a lot of programming experience. After we passed the class, I decided to continue working on the project myself. Small bugs still need to be fixed and the computing time is still a bit long. The data set used at the beginning has also been changed and the program still needs to be adapted and optimized to this new format.

  - Read the complet manual [here](https://github.com/JosephBisso/Starlink/blob/master/manual%20instruction/Anleitung.pdf). This project was wirtten using **Qt Creator**.

### [Card game](https://github.com/JosephBisso/Cardgame)

- Cardgame is a implementation of a physical Card game. For now there is only one pre-programmed Game but with this programm you can play a large number of card games if you know the rule and want to create a new Game with existing rules. But more (popular) Games are definitling in the way. Stay tunned!

- Your opponents will be AIs. The last Player with remaining Card loose the Game. For now neither the number of Ais nor their Level can be changed, but I played a couple hundred games and sometimes I win and sometimes I loose. Either way I had a lot of fun

- This project is written and _tested automatically_ using **Gradle** and **JUnit**
